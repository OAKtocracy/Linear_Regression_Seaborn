# Linear_Regression_Seaborn
I used Seaborn, Numpy and Matplotlib to explore, clean and analyse data related to the cause of death at Vienna General Hospital. Then I used plotly to plot relevant data against another to visualise relationships in the data and I used skipy for probabilistic distributions and statistical operations.
